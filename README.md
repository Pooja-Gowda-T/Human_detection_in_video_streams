# Human_detection_in_video_streams
Detecting humans in films and videos is a challenging problem owing to the motion of the subjects, the camera background and variation in pose, appearance, clothing, illumination and the background clutter. 


# Description: 
This project will detect the human in the video streams.
•	This system will measure fps (frames per second).
•	calculates the dwell time (the amount of time the person is visible within the frame).
•	This project will also track the individual person in the video by assigning the unique id to each individual. 
•	Keeping in mind the current pandemic situation this project will also detect if the person is maintaining social distancing.


# Tools & Technologies Used:
•	Language used- Python
•	OpenCV: A strong library used for machine learning
•	Imutils: To Image Processing. NumPy, Argparse.
•	HOG is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing and SVM (support vector machine).
